//We're going to create the JS for a basic quiz application. 

//Let's think about the nature of this quiz app first. We're going to be creating lots of user objects, and we're
//also going to be creating lots of Question objects. Those would make two perfectly good constructors. 

//Create a User constructor that accepts name, email, password, and totalScore parameters and set them appropriatly

var User = function(name, email, password, totalScore){
  this.name = name;
  this.email = email;
  this.password = password;
  this.totalScore = totalScore;
}


//Create a Question constructor that accepts title, answersArray, rightAnswer, and difficulty parameters

var Question = function(title, answersArray, rightAnswer, difficulty){
  this.title = title;
  this.answerArray = answersArray;
  this.rightAnswer = rightAnswer;
  this.difficulty = difficulty;
}


//Create a users Array which is going to hold all of our users.

var users = [];


//Let's say three people signed up for our service, create 3 instances of User and add each to the users Array

users.push(new User('brad', 'brad@email.com', 'pswrd', 90));
users.push(new User('gary', 'gary@email.com', 'pssfwrd', 90));
users.push(new User('letty', 'letty@email.com', 'pswafrd', 90));


//Create a questions Array which is going to hold all of our questions

var questions = [];


//Now, let's say we wanted to create a quiz about JavaScript. Create three instances of Question which contain the following data
//title: 'T/F: Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypes?'
//title: 'T/F: JavaScript is just a scripting version of Java'
//title: "T/F: In Javascript, == doesn't check 'type' but just the value - where === checks type and value"
//Fill in the rest of the required data as you see appropriate.

var question1 = new Question('T/F: Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypes?', 'answers', 1, 4);
var question2 = new Question('T/F: JavaScript is just a scripting version of Java', 'answers', 1, 4);
var question3 = new Question("T/F: In Javascript, == doesn't check 'type' but just the value - where === checks type and value", 'answers', 1, 4);
               

//Now push all of your instances of Question into the questions Array

questions.push(question1, question2, question3);

console.log('My users Array and my questions arrray are ...', users, questions);
//Now loop console.log your users array and your questions array and verify that they're both holding the right data.

for (var i = 0; i < users.length; i++){
  console.log(users[i], questions[i])
}

for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++){
  console.log(questions[i])
}
